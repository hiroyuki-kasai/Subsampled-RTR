% RTRMC installation script.
% 
% BEFORE your run this script, try to simply execute main and see if
% it works. If it doesn't, then it is probably because the C-Mex codes need
% to be compiled. Launching this script should do the trick. If compilation
% fails, then you probably need to set up your C-compiler correctly for
% Matlab. Type "mex -setup" at the command prompt for help with this.
% From there, instructions for different Matlab versions and operating
% systems are easily reachable.
%
% If you have trouble installing/using this code, feel free to contact the
% authors at: nicolasboumal@gmail.com
%
%
% Please note that you will also need Manopt to use the RTRMC algorithms.
% A version of Manopt should be packaged with this release. If so, simply
% execute the importmanopt script in the corresponding folder. Preferably,
% you can get a more up-to-date version and documentation on
% 
%      www.manopt.org
