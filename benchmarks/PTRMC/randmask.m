function [I J kk] = randmask(m, n, k, fencemax)
% FUNCTION [I J KK] = RANDMASK(M, N, K, FENCEMAX)
%
% This code is used only to generate random problem instances, not to solve
% problems.
%
% Random mask: we randomly select K entries in an M-by-N matrix and return
% their indices (row indices in I, column indices in J) in uint32 class.
% The code is based on the assumption that K << MN, that an MN vector does
% not fit in memory and that it is complicated to uniformly generate a
% single integer in the range 1:MN. The code will usually select K entries,
% but it sometimes abandons with slightly less than K. The number of
% selected entries is returned in KK.
%
% FENCEMAX is the maximum number of tries (a higher number increases the
% chance that we will get the correct number of samples in the mask, but
% increases computation time too).
