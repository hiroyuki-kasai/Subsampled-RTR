function problem = buildproblem(I, J, X, C, m, n, r, lambda)
% PROBLEM = BUILDPROBLEM(I, J, X, C, M, N, R, LAMBDA)
%
% Build a structure describing a low-rank matrix completion problem, to be
% used with RTRMC.
%
% Inputs:
%
% I, J, X, C: Column vectors of equal length such that the k-th known entry
%             of the matrix to recover is at position (I(k), J(k)) and has
%             value X(k), with confidence C(k). If C is set to the empty
%             matrix, it will be set to ones(size(X)).
% 
% M, N, R:    The matrix to recover is M-by-N and assumed to be of rank R.
%             RTRMC works best if M <= N. If this is not the case, one
%             should build the problem as follows:
%             BUILDPROBLEM(J, I, X, C, N, M, R, LAMBDA),
%             i.e., build a problem structure for the transpose of the
%             matrix to recover, call RTRMC to solve the problem, which
%             yields factors U and W, then obtain the reconstructed matrix
%             as W'*U' instead of U*W.
%
% LAMBDA:     A small smoothing factor, set in accordance with the noise
%             level.
% IMPORTANT!  If LAMBDA is to be changed later on, one should
%             call BUILDPROBLEM to obtain a new structure and not simply
%             change the value of LAMBDA in the existing problem structure,
%             seen as LAMBDA is used to precompute a number of other fields
%             in the problem structure.
% 
% 
% Output:
%
% PROBLEM:    A structure to be passed to RTRMC to solve the low-rank
%             matrix completion problem.

% Modified on March 6, 2014 to prevent a former bug linked to the ordering
% of vectors I, J, X and C. The function will now return a proper problem
% structure for use with the RTRMC algorithms. Fields I, J, X and C in this
% problem structure may have been re-ordered (consistently).
